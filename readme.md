# Fall Detection System 

### The Project and Example Runs is Located here: [Fall Detection Final Project](./project.ipynb)
Note: The trained model's weight file (average_model.pth) is too large (~600 MB) and cannot be uploaded on github. It's submitted on Canvas instead along with everything else.

### To Start the Fall Detection Web Application in the project.ipynb
Run the following command in a jupyter notebook: *python app.py*

![Start Web App](./markdown_images/start_web_app.png)

The fall detection application allow users to upload an MP4 video to detect falls. 
![Fall Detection App](./markdown_images/web_demo1.png) 


If the app detect frames where the fall happens, then the frames will be shown along with the message: Fall Detected.

If the app did not detect any falls in the video, the app will display the message: No Falls Detected.
